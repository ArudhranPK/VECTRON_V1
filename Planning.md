# **Planning**

## **First thing to do**

Remember to make custom symbols
- [ ] Proper schematics with datasheet references (footprint later on)

## **Software**

### Micro SD card
- [ ] integration testing
- [ ] Driver code

### ISM330DHCX IMU
- [ ] Integration testing
- [ ] Driver code

### LIS2MDL magnetometer
- [ ] integration testing
- [ ] Driver code

### NEO-6M GPS 
- [ ] integration testing
- [ ] Driver code

### BMP280 barometer
- [x] integration testing
- [ ] Driver code

## **Hardware**

Remeber to make custom footprints

- [ ] Complete schematic fully
- [ ] Check schematics (Find errors)
- [ ] Check if Micro SD can be run by only 1 bit bus
- [ ] Check for simulations
- [ ] Learn about Control Systems
- [ ] Learn about Control Systems for rockets
- [ ] Check for the Op-Amp and mosfet trigger and continuity
